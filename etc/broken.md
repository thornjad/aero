# Things currently broken or missing in Aero

More or less a TODO list

- LSP doesn't work in HTML (particularly Angular)
- jest always rebuilds on startup
- Emacs crashes on Mac M1 a lot. some errors include:
    - Compressor failed a blocking pager_get
    - KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x4091900104914608 -> 0xffff900104914608
    - pmap_enter failed with resource shortage
- In markdown mode, typing `[ ` results in `[ ]]`
