# Things I like from zed which Aero should have

- Command palette? I've tried this several times and never been quite sure on it
  - ivy-posframe
- focus on collaborative editing
- better completion, feels more snappy
  - maybe try removing tabnine?
- terminal at bottom of screen, all terminals go there
  - tried this before and didn't care much, maybe find a package?
- nicer display of diagnostics
  - maybe a package?
