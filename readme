  Aero is my own Emacs configuration, blending all the best shit I can find. It
  is built in the style of a distribution like Prelude or Spacemacs, but it's
  not intended for widespread use; Aero is highly tailored to me, what I want
  and what I use. Special focus is put on writing Lisps, Python, TCL, Node and
  the several web languages. Other languages like C and ML have some light
  configuration as well.

  Emacs changes the way you think about programming, as does Lisp itself. The
  sheer power of advanced usage makes IDEs look like clunky lemons. It is backed
  by decades of rich experience and a fantastic culture.

  "Emacs outshines all other editing software in the same way that the noonday
  sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes
  everything else vanish." — Neal Stephenson

  "While any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your soul." —
  Per Abrahamsen

  "The reasonable man adapts himself to Emacs; the unreasonable one persists in
  trying to adapt Emacs to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the
  unreasonable man." — G.B. Shaw

  "You could be a total lunatic, and Emacs has to make you happy" — Steve Yegge

  "Emacs is the ground. We run around and act silly on top of it, and when we
  die, may our remnants grace its ongoing incrementation." — Thien-Thi Nguyen

  "Thou shalt not cross 80 columns in thy file" — God, probably

REQUIREMENTS

  Aero works best with Remacs, or at least Emacs 27. It should run on Emacs as
  far back as 25.1, but this is not tested. Aero is optimized for the font Dank
  Mono, but Source Code Pro is pretty good too.

INSTALLATION
