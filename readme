  Aero is my own approach to Emacs, blending all the best shit I can find. It is
  not intended for widespread use; it is tailored for what I want and use.

  Emacs changes the way you think about programming, as does Lisp itself. The
  sheer power of advanced usage makes IDEs look like clunky lemons. It is backed
  by decades of rich experience and a fantastic culture.

  Special focus is put on writing Lisps, Python, TCL, Node and the several web
  languages.

  "Emacs outshines all other editing software in the same way that the
  noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it
  simply makes everything else vanish." — Neal Stephenson

	"While any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your
	soul." — Per Abrahamsen

  "The reasonable man adapts himself to Emacs; the unreasonable one
  persists in trying to adapt Emacs to himself. Therefore all progress
  depends on the unreasonable man." — G.B. Shaw

  "Thou shalt not cross 80 columns in thy file"
