	Aero is my own Emacs configuration, blending all the best shit I can find. It
	is built in the style of a distribution like Prelude or Spacemacs, but it's
	not intended for widespread use; Aero is highly tailored to me, what I want
	and what I use.

	Emacs changes the way you think about programming, as does Lisp itself. The
	sheer power of advanced usage makes IDEs look like clunky lemons. It is backed
	by decades of rich experience and a fantastic culture.

	Special focus is put on writing Lisps, Python, TCL, Node and the several web
	languages. Other languages like C and OCaml have some light configuration as
	well.

	"Emacs outshines all other editing software in the same way that the noonday
	sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes
	everything else vanish." — Neal Stephenson

	"While any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your soul." —
	Per Abrahamsen

	"The reasonable man adapts himself to Emacs; the unreasonable one persists in
	trying to adapt Emacs to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the
	unreasonable man." — G.B. Shaw

	"Emacs is the ground. We run around and act silly on top of it, and when we
	die, may our remnants grace its ongoing incrementation." — Thien-Thi Nguyen

	"Thou shalt not cross 80 columns in thy file" — God, probably

REQUIREMENTS

	Aero works best with Remacs, or at least Emacs 27. It should run on Emacs as
	far back as 25.1, but this is not tested. Aero is optimized for the font Dank
	Mono, but Source Code Pro is pretty good too.

INSTALLATION

	Clone or download this repository into your ~/.emacs.d. There are three
	mirrors to choose from:
