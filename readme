  Aero is my own Emacs configuration, blending all the best shit I can find. It
  is built in the style of a distribution like Prelude or Spacemacs, but it's
  not intended for widespread use; Aero is highly tailored to me, what I want
  and what I use. Special focus is put on writing Lisps, Python, TCL, Node and
  the several web languages. Other languages like C and ML have some light
  configuration as well.

  Emacs changes the way you think about programming, as does Lisp itself. The
  sheer power of advanced usage makes IDEs look like clunky lemons. It is backed
  by decades of rich experience and a fantastic culture.

  "Emacs outshines all other editing software in the same way that the noonday
  sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes
  everything else vanish." — Neal Stephenson

  "While any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your soul." —
  Per Abrahamsen

  "The reasonable man adapts himself to Emacs; the unreasonable one persists in
  trying to adapt Emacs to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the
  unreasonable man." — G.B. Shaw

  "You could be a total lunatic, and Emacs has to make you happy" — Steve Yegge

  "Emacs is the ground. We run around and act silly on top of it, and when we
  die, may our remnants grace its ongoing incrementation." — Thien-Thi Nguyen

  "Thou shalt not cross 80 columns in thy file" — Linus Torvalds

REQUIREMENTS

  Aero is maintained as a cutting-edge tool, and focuses on working best with
  the latest minor version of Emacs, and should keep parity with the latest
  Remacs. Aero is optimized for a TTY environment with 256 colors. It looks best
  with the font Victor Mono, but Dank Mono and Source Code Pro look pretty sick
  too.

INSTALLATION

  Clone or download this repository into your ~/.config/emacs/. There are three
  mirrors to choose from:

  GitLab (best)     https://gitlab.com/thornjad/aero.git
  Framagit (better) https://framagit.org/thornjad/aero.git
  GitHub (ok)       https://github.com/thornjad/aero.git

  Then, install and compile required submodules with =make=

LOCAL CONFIG

  Local settings, functions, et cetera can be put into an untracked
  ~/.config/emacs/init.local.el file, which will be evaluated near the end of
  the initialization process, after all other layers and settings.

WARNING

  As stated above, this is not intended for widespread usage. Bindings, settings
  and packages change all the time with no warning or documentation. Use at your
  own risk. If you want to use anything, it may be safer to copy what your want
  to your own configuration, or to make a stable fork.
