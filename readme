  Aero is my own Emacs configuration, blending all the best shit I can find. It
  is built in the style of a distribution like Prelude or Spacemacs, but it's
  not intended for widespread use; Aero is highly tailored to me, what I want
  and what I use.

  Emacs changes the way you think about programming, as does Lisp itself. The
  sheer power of advanced usage makes IDEs look like clunky lemons. It is backed
  by decades of rich experience and a fantastic culture.

  Special focus is put on writing Lisps, Python, TCL, Node and the several web
  languages. Other languages like C and OCaml have some light configuration as
  well.

  "Emacs outshines all other editing software in the same way that the noonday
  sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes
  everything else vanish." — Neal Stephenson

  "While any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your soul." —
  Per Abrahamsen

  "The reasonable man adapts himself to Emacs; the unreasonable one persists in
  trying to adapt Emacs to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the
  unreasonable man." — G.B. Shaw

  "Thou shalt not cross 80 columns in thy file" — God, probably

EXIGENCES

  Aero requires Emacs 25.1 or higher. Remacs is buggy, but is supported. Aero is
  optimized to use the font Dank Mono, but also works great with Source Code
  Pro.
