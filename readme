AERO EMACS

Aero is my own approach to Emacs, blending Spacemacs, Prelude and whatever other
good shit I can find. Aero is not intended for widespread use; it is tailored
for what I want and use.

CREDO

Productivity, elegance, improvement

Emacs changes the way you think about programming, as does Lisp itself. The
sheer power of advanced usage makes IDEs look like clunky lemons. It is backed
by decades of rich experience and a fantastic culture. Spacemacs is a beautiful
and highly functional extension which provides the perfect base for productivity.

Aero does not adhere to any versioning, instead it is a continuously improving,
evolving ambition.

INSTALLING

Aero requires Emacs 25.1 or higher. Remacs is buggy, but is supported. DO NOT
use XEmacs, it is not supported.

Aero is optimized to use the font Dank Mono, but also works great with Source
Code Pro.

		git clone https://gitlab.com/thornjad/aero ~/.emacs.d
		cd ~/.emacs.d
		make setup

Note that the =make setup= step is only a stopgap for the time being and will
eventually be unecessary.
