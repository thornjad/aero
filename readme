AERO EMACS

Aero is my own approach to Emacs, blending all the best shit I can find. It is
not intended for widespread use; it is tailored for what I want and use.

Emacs changes the way you think about programming, as does Lisp itself. The
sheer power of advanced usage makes IDEs look like clunky lemons. It is backed
by decades of rich experience and a fantastic culture.

This configuration features Spacemacs-esque leader-key-based bindings, a module
system inspired by Prelude and many functions, macros and tweaks borrowed from
the like of Samuel Barreto, Steve Purcell, James Sulak and Michael Markert. The
theme is modeled on Doom (and includes the Doom mode line).

Special focus is put on writing Lisps, Python, TCL, Node and the several web
languages.

INSTALLING

Aero requires Emacs 25.1 or higher. Remacs is buggy, but is supported. DO NOT
use XEmacs, it is not supported.

Aero is optimized to use the font Dank Mono, but also works great with Source
Code Pro.
