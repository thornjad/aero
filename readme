Aero is my own approach to Emacs, blending all the best shit I can find. It is
not intended for widespread use; it is tailored for what I want and use.

Emacs changes the way you think about programming, as does Lisp itself. The
sheer power of advanced usage makes IDEs look like clunky lemons. It is backed
by decades of rich experience and a fantastic culture.

Special focus is put on writing Lisps, Python, TCL, Node and the several web
languages.

INSTALLING

Aero requires Emacs 25.1 or higher. Remacs is buggy, but is supported. Aero is
optimized to use the font Dank Mono, but also works great with Source Code Pro.

To install, clone or download this repository into your ~/.emacs.d. There are
three mirrors to choose from:

GitLab (best)     https://gitlab.com/thornjad/aero
Framagit (better) https://framagit.org/thornjad/aero
GitHub (ok)       https://github.com/thornjad/aero
