;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs 27 introduced early-init.el, which is run before init.el, before
;; package and UI initialization happens.
;;
;;; Code:

;; Use most recent byte-compiled files
(setq load-prefer-newer t)

;; Native-compile async
(setq native-comp-jit-compilation t)

;; Ensure that quitting only occurs once Emacs finishes native compiling,
;; preventing incomplete or leftover compilation files in `/tmp`.
(setq native-comp-async-query-on-exit t)
(setq confirm-kill-processes t)

;; Package initialize occurs automatically, before `user-init-file' is loaded, but after
;; `early-init-file'. We want Aero to handle this, so stop Emacs from doing it on its own.
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Always use utf-8 for everything, I'll change it on the fly if I need something else for some
;; reason.
(set-charset-priority 'unicode)
(set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8)
(set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
(setq default-process-coding-system '(utf-8-unix . utf-8-unix))

;; Disable useless UI features by default.
