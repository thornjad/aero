Here lives my own Emacs configuration, blending all the best shit I can find, making a conscious effort for speed, robustness and above all, skilfullness.. I built Aero in the style of a distribution like Prelude or Spacemacs, but without intention for widespread use; I've tailored Aero to myself,, what I want and what I use. Configuration for Lisps, Python and web languages have special focus.

** Requirements
Aero evolves as a cutting-edge tool and focuses on working with the latest version of Emacs.

To take full advantage of this project, install these tools:

- Node.js
- Python 3
- Rust and rustup
- Ocaml and opam
- Nix

Having cloned and met dependency requirements,, run =make= to set up dependencies.

If you'd rather not install these dependencies, take a look at the Makefile and just install what you want to use.

** Installation

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/thornjad/aero.git ~/.config/emacs
cd ~/.config/emacs
make
#+end_src

** Local config
Local settings, functions, et cetera existing in an untracked =init.local.el= file will evaluate near the end of the initialization process, after all other layers and settings.

** Major features, changes and decisions
**** Evil
#+begin_quote
"Emacs is a great operating system, lacking only a decent editor." — ancient Vi proverb
#+end_quote

Emacs keybindings belong in the dark ages where they originated. They might work for RMS, but I can only hold =CTRL= for so long. Instead, Aero makes extensive use of [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil]], providing the user with modifier-key-free modal editing, though the majority of Emacs bindings remain available..

**** Spacemacs-inspired leader keys
When I first started using Emacs, I took full advantage of Spacemacs, so the architecture of that project has shaped the way I think about editing. As such, the majority of Aero revolves around one of two leader keys, =SPC= and =,= (comma). =SPC= leads the vast majority of commands. =SPC SPC= is the same as =M-x=, =SPC f w= (for file write) saves the buffer to disk.

The other leader, =,= contains bindings for specific major modes. For example, in Python mode, =, s b= sends the entire buffer to Elpy's inferior Python shell and executes it, and in =restclient=, =, RET= runs the HTTP query at point.

**** LSP
Emacs should support LSP out of the box. Since it doesn't, Aero makes up the difference by connecting to protocol servers as have proved useful to me thus far. I regularly make use of these capabilities in Python, OCaml and Javascript in particular, so they've received the most love.

**** No tagged versioning
As mentioned above, Aero does intend to go mainstream like Spacemacs or Prelude. This project consists of personal configuration, pure and simple. As such, versioning provides no benefit; git provides plenty of control. If you want to use this entire project for your own Emacs configuration, I recommend forking to avoid unexpected changes.

**** Custom theme and a simplified mode line
Aero replaces the default awful color scheme with the eponymous =aero-theme=, which pulls loose inspiration from the [[https://github.com/11111000000/tao-theme-emacs][Tao themes]] and colors inspired by the colors of northern Minnesota in Autumn. The theme package also contains =aero-dark=, which incorporates further inspiration from my own [[https://github.com/ClearNight/clearnight-retro-syntax][ClearNight Retro]] theme for [[https://atom.io][Atom]].

With Aero, you'll also find a custom improved mode line which works with any theme (though it looks great with =aero-light= and =aero-dark=). Rather than getting cluttered with info from every mode under the sun, the Aero mode line displays the current editing mode, file status (changed, saved, locked), filename, file size, line number at point, progression through the file (percentage), the remote hostname (if using TRAMP) and the current major mode.

**** Source-controlled Flycheck dictionary
The built-in Flycheck dictionary lacks woefully in technical terms. Rather than keep my personal dictionary secret, it lives in =etc/ispell/personal_dictionary.aws=, under the normal source control. I haven't dug into the implementation of this library, but due to the way it reshuffles itself occasionally, I presume it uses some type of tree structure. As such, if you want to merge my dictionary with your own, you may not find it as easy as a simple copy-paste procedure. Then again, maybe it will self-correct itself. And maybe one day I'll bother to find out for myself. Maybe.

** Note
This configuration undergoes constant evolution. Bindings, settings and packages change with no warning and little to no documentation. This project does not exist as a prebuilt configuration like Spacemacs, but rather as a reference or source of ideas. Use at your own risk.

To get started with Emacs, I highly recommend [[https://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]].
