* Aero Emacs

This is a highly opinionated approach to Emacs, based heavily on [[http://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]], with
some additional influence from [[https://prelude.emacsredux.com/en/latest/][Prelude]]. Despite customization, the vast majority
of the core infrastructure is forked directly from Spacemacs.

Aero is not intended to be a widespread project. It is tailored to what I use
Emacs for and features I like.

/If you would like to contribute, I highly recommend you contribute to Spacemacs
instead/. Don't worry, it will make its way to Aero eventually.

*** Why?

Aero exists for much the same reason that people publish their Emacs settings,
to display what I think works best. However, this is more than simply publishing
my =init.el= for one simple, sinful reason: vanity. Aero is /mine/ and I like it
that way.

Aero is based on Spacemacs because it provides a beautiful interface to Emacs,
backed by a vibrant developer culture. It makes Emacs' inherent extensibility
more accessible, as well as providing an excellent navigational system through
the space leader.

It all comes down to Emacs, however. Emacs will change how you think about
programming, as will Lisp itself. The sheer power of advanced usage makes IDEs
look like clunky lemons (looking at you, Eclipse). It is backed by decades of
rich experience and a fantastic culture built around great documentation, even
providing multiple interactive tutorials. Despite an [[https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Cu9Z.jpg][infamous learning curve]].

Aero is intended to run on [[https://github.com/remacs/remacs][Remacs]], though it is not very stable. Remacs intends
to make Emacs development more accessible to a younger generation, eventually
enabling them to carry the torch from the current aging core and bring Emacs
into the future. It will also bring speedups, both in execution time and
development time, hopefully bringing about speedier development of big features,
such as fully-asynchronous operations.

** Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available for each layer, press =SPC h SPC=.

Also check Spacemacs's [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/DOCUMENTATION.org][general documentation]], [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/QUICK_START.org][quick start guide]] and [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/FAQ.org][FAQ]]. Very
little documentation is kept in this repository, please defer to Spacemacs most
of the time.

** Prerequisites

Aero is an extension of Emacs and requires Emacs 25.1 or above. Remacs is buggy,
but is supported.

*** Linux

Install =emacs= from your distribution's package manager. /Do not/ install
=xemacs=, it is not supported.

*** macOS

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
brew cask install emacs
#+END_SRC

*** Fonts

While Spacemacs officially recommends Source Code Pro, Aero is customized
slightly to use Dank Mono. Most monospaced fonts should work, though some may
have spacing peculiarities.

** Install

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/thornjad/aero ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
make setup
#+END_SRC

Note that the final ~make setup~ is only a stopgap during the development of
Aero, and will eventually go away.

** License

Aero is licensed under the GPLv3. For packages shipped in this repository, refer
